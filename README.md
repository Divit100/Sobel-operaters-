# Sobel-operaters-

In this small project ,the edges with respect to horizontal and vertical deratives are successfully detected using the Sobel Operators.

The image with Sobel Y derativ applied:

In the code section of the repository, The laplacian operator has both the derivates due to which the edges are not that clearly detected as compared to the Sobel operators.With some research,I found that as Laplacian operator contains both x and y deratives so it is more prone to noise .
